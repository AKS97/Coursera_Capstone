    "Because Bangalore is known as silicon valley of India, So many people from different parts of country moves to Bangalore but India is very  big and Diverse every part of a country is different from each other be it language, culture, food or anything else. A large number of people who move to Bangalore are from New Delhi and nearby area (NCR, UP, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan). They know New Delhi very well but Bangalore is totally different. So we will try to cluster New Delhi and Bangalore Based on similarity. That is we will cluster New Delhi on the basis of Neighbourhood and cluster Bangalore on the basis of Neighbourhood and will tell which places of New Delhi is similar to which places of Bangalore. This will help not only the new people moving to Bangalore but also those who are already living in Bangalore but are looking for change.So anyone who wants to shift to Bangalore from North India might be intrested in this project"

Moreover we will use foresquare api to get the information about various amenities or facilities available in these places based on which we will cluster theses cities. We will clustered New Delhi then predict on Bangalore to get the simillarity between these two cities."

    "We used K Means clustering in order to find the simillarities between New Delhi and Bangalore. One of the reasons that we used K Means was that it allows us to predict on some unknown datasets like a supervised learning. As this is an Unsupervised Learning their are not many ways to evaluate the putcome of our model but we Evaluated it with the help of silhouette coefficient which computes the compactness of a cluster, where higher is better, with a perfect score of 1. Which is not necessarily true for our case.But we clustered with different algorithms like DBSCAN, Agglomarative and K Means where the result of Aglomarative and K Means where almost same. Apart from that after we succesfully clustered both the cities I manually checked for the clusters which were quite simillar. So overall our model is working and we can tell anyone which part of New Delhi is simillar to Bangalore.\n",

    "We collected our data from multiple Wikipedia pages with the help of pythons web scrapping capabilities. Then we utilize geopy to some extent to get the coordinates of some of the locations of New Delhi and Bangalore and rest I filled manually. After that we merged both together to query the Foresquare API then we parsed the result and stored it into a Dataframe. Later we used that to sort the most common venues everywhere. One more step to go before we can start building our model that is Data Preprocessing wehere we converted the categorical variables into numerical with the help of One Hot Encoding and also calculated the mean frequency of occurance of each category of the venues of the Neighborhoods. Finally we built our model with the help of K Means Clustering algorithm where we clustered New Delhi and then used our model to Predict the values or cluster for Bangalore."
